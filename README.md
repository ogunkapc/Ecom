# 🛒 E-Commerce Product REST API

This is a simple backend service I built while learning Java and Spring Boot.  
It manages products for an e-commerce system — with basic CRUD functionality and image upload.

I used this project to get hands-on practice with Spring Boot, working with services, DTOs, file uploads, and JPA repositories.
